Todo:
Stian: Input
Baptiste:Bandpass Modulation
BÃ¸rge: Pulse Modulation


*Link budget
-Loss and gain for transmitted and recieved signal
-Noises
-Verifications in the design, to link with theory
-Frii's formula

*Error correction coding


*Latex project overview


*Specifications:
-Range: 10m ca
-bitdepth: 8bit
-sample rate: 10kHz
-Bitrate: 64kbits
-Frequency: 2,45GHz (needs more checking out of spectrum)
-Sound quality: Poor-ok
-Delay: 5ms
-Bandwitdh: 20MHz 2,44-2,46
-Complexity: Low
-Power: Low(from formula to 10m transmitting range)
-Interference: None

*Design motivation
-Data rate: bit rate
-Bandwidth: 20MHz
-Source	coding: 
-Channel	coding:
-Interleaver: Error correction
-Modulation PSK
-Demodulation PSK
-Synchronization
Freq choosen, in the middle of ism-band to avoid interference. Bandwith for the same reason, small enough, and large enough for data transfer
