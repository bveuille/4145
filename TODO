Todo:


*Link budget
-Loss and gain for transmitted and recieved signal
-Noises
-Verifications in the design, to link with theory
-Frii's formula

*Error correction coding


*Latex project overview


*Specifications:
-Range: 10m ca
-Bitrate: 64kbits
-Frequency: 2,45GHz (needs more checking out of spectrum)
-Sound quality: Poor-ok
-Delay: 5ms
-Bandwitdh: 20MHz 2,44-2,46
-Complexity: Low
-Power: Low
-Interference: None

*Design motivation
Freq choosen, in the middle of ism-band to avoid interference. Bandwith for the same reason, small enough, and large enough for data transfer
